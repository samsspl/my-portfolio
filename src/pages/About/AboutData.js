      `Hi! I’m Sai Sam Phyo Linn, a passionate full-stack software engineer with a knack for turning challenges into opportunities. My tech journey began during my first role as a System Administrator, where I spent five years managing system maintenance and exploring the intricacies of Linux scripting and command-line tools. Coming from an electrical engineering background, I’ll admit that staring at shell scripts for the first time felt like deciphering an alien language. But that initial confusion sparked a curiosity that changed everything.`,
      `After two years in the role, I realized that to advance further in my career, I needed to deeply understand how the systems and scripts I worked with truly operated. Motivated by this realization, I pursued a Bachelor of Technology in Software Engineering, which provided me with the tools and knowledge to decode what once seemed incomprehensible. My studies not only transformed my technical skills but also ignited a passion for software development.`,
      `Fast forward to today, I’m hooked on creating innovative and efficient solutions, particularly in financial technology—a field I’ve focused on through my professional work. My approach is grounded in a relentless drive for learning, a love for collaboration, and an insatiable curiosity for the ever-evolving tech landscape. Whether it’s designing user-centric applications or solving complex backend challenges, I strive to build solutions that truly make an impact.`,
